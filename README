done -- a simple, elegant command line todo list tool

done is a todo list tool designed for me. You might enjoy it, as well.

It was inspired by the interface to Darcs. It is also written in Haskell.

It uses sqlite3.

Note: I'm still a fledgling Haskell programmer. Progress on this project will be glacial.
